The sensor has to be exposed to fresh air for at least 1 hour every day.  \n\n    **the sensor may not be disconnected from the power supply,otherwise the procedure to find calibration parameters is aborted and has to be restarted from the beginning**\n\n    User can run the SCD30_auto_calibration.ino to start the calibration.\n***\n\n\n\n\nThis software is written by Wayen Weng for seeed studio and is licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
