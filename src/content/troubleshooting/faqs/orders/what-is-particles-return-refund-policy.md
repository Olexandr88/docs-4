## Returns overview
This section will give you an overview of our return policy for wherever you may have purchased our products.
General returns guidelines

Please contact us at our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) before sending any products back to us. If an order is returned to us without approval for any reason, you will not receive a refund.
A 10% restocking fee will be deducted from any refunds issued.
Your original shipping charge will not be refunded.
Returns may take up to 30 business days to process, not including transit times.
Replacement orders can not be modified to include different or additional parts.
You are responsible for return shipping charges that are not related to a manufacturer error.
If your return is not received in restockable condition, we reserve the right to change your refund amount or method (e.g., limit your refund to store credit).
Modified items are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for the eligibility of returns. We cannot guarantee that we’ll accept modified items back.


## 30-Day unopened return policy 
If you are not 100% satisfied with your order, we will be happy to arrange a return for any unopened items purchased within 30 days. Simply visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) with your order number, email address you used to place the order, and a brief description of the reason for the return. Please note your refund will be subject to a restocking fee of 10% per device and you will be responsible for the return shipping.

## Modified or opened product return policy
If you are struggling with a Particle product or aren’t satisfied with your purchase, there are a number of ways to resolve the issue. First, look for troubleshooting tips and assistance on our [documentation page](/troubleshooting/led/). If you don’t find the answer there, our amazing [community](https://community.particle.io/) is also a great resource and can most likely help you out. If you still are having trouble, visit us at our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) to begin basic troubleshooting with our team. Often, defective units have simple misconfigurations that can easily be fixed, and this will put you in a position to quickly and easily resolve certain issues if they crop up again.

If we determine that something is wrong with your product due to a manufacturing defect or error, we will be happy to replace your item(s) as needed, or issue you a refund/credit depending on product availability. Please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) and let us know your order number, the product you’re having issues with, and a detailed description of the problems you’re seeing. For broken products, please include pictures. They are worth a thousand words.

If your product is opened and working as expected, we are unable to issue you a refund. However, please feel free to reach out to our support team so that we can try to assist in any way possible.

## Damaged in shipment

We've partnered with [Route](https://route.com/), a package protection and tracking solution, to give our customers the best possible delivery experience. 

If your original order was insured by Route and you are experiencing an issue with your order or delivery, please file a claim on the [Route claims page](https://route.com/). By opting out of package protection during the checkout process, Particle is not liable for lost, damaged, or stolen items once the shipment has left our warehouse.

## Orders placed through a distributor
If you placed your original order through one of our distributors, please see their website for the applicable return/replacement/refund policy. For potentially defective units, we can offer advice, troubleshoot or diagnose any issue that might have come up. First, look for troubleshooting tips and assistance about your issue on our [documentation page](/troubleshooting/led/). If you don’t find it there, our amazing [community](https://community.particle.io/) can most likely help you out. If you still are having trouble, visit us at our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/).

If we determine that something is wrong with your product due to a manufacturing defect or error, we will be happy to replace your item(s) as needed or offer you a discount/credit for our store depending on product availability. Please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) and let us know the product you’re having issues with along with a detailed description of the problems you’re seeing. Be sure to let us know which distributor you ordered your item(s) from as well. For physically broken products that were damaged in transit, please contact the original distributor.

If you purchase devices from a third party or unapproved distributor, all Particle return policies and warranties will be void. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://www.particle.io/legal/terms-of-service/) for more information.


## Modules incorporated into custom boards
We can only perform limited troubleshooting on modules built into custom boards. If you’re interested in more in-depth troubleshooting, please visit our [support portal](https://support.particle.io/) and let us know you’re interested in working with one of our [service partners](https://www.particle.io/partners/) for an in-depth technical review of your custom board.
